Based on an old PC game called "Time War" that I can no longer find information on, Super Temporal engages players in a game of war and conquest where events in the past ripple forward and effect the future.
The game also bares heavy resemblance to a 1979 board game called "Time War" which I did not know about during development.

The game can be played locally with pass and play by using index.html in the Site folder or Online by launching the server using node and the launch.sh script in the Server folder and using the Client webpage in the Client folder.
