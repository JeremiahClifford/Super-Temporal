Based on an old PC game called "Time War" that I can no longer find information on, Super Temporal Warfare engages players in a game of war and conquest where events in the past ripple forward and effect the future.
The game also bares heavy resemblance to a 1979 board game called "Time War" which I did not know about during developement.

The game can be played locally with pass and play by using index.html in the Site folder.

An online multiplayer version is in the works with the Server and Client Folders.
