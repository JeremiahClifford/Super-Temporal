The Specifics:
-Temporal Warfare is a game of perfect information: that is, all players can see the troops,
   resources, and buildings in each time zone and in each players' ship at all times.

The Setting:
-5 (temp number) planets which are all separate and do not interact
-Each planet has 10 (temp number, maybe 15) time zones which each act as a territory

The Time Zones:
-Each time zone has resources, buildings, troops and stats.
-Each time zone level is 2 times as powerful as the level before
-Additionally, each time zone has a small randomly generated modifier which makes it slightly
  different from the same level on different planets
-Each territory generates resources each turn.

Resources:
-Resources are used to build buildings
-You must have resources in a time zone to build in that time zone.

Buildings:
-Building are built on time periods using resources
-Buildings can change the time period specific troop modifier: making troops trained there better
-Buildings can be used to increase resource generation
-Buildings can give defenders a defensive boost on that specific time period

Troops:
-Training troops costs resources upfront
   -a certain number of troops is then output each turn until the ordered amount has been created
   -the player must be in a time zone to order troops to be created
-Troops all carry with them the stats from the time zone they were created in
-Each troop has the time zone level value
    -This can be changed through integration
-Each troop has the modifier value from the specific time zone in which is was created
    -This can not be changed
-Each troop has an experience value gained from taking part in combat which increases its power
   -this increases when the troops engages in combat

Integration:
-If a troop spends a turn in a time zone of a higher level than it is, it integrates, moving up 1
   level until it matches the time zone level that it is in
-Troops that are of a higher level than the time period they are in will not integrate.

Propagation:
-Whenever resources are generated, moved in, or moved out; buildings are built or upgraded; or 
   troops are trained, moved in, or moved out, that change propagates, that is, to then be added 
   to the next time zone up a level at the level appropriate to that level
      if troop of a lower level are added, such that they will later integrate, they are propagated
      up 1 level, not all the way up to the level of the next time zone
-When a time zone is conquered, a wall is created preventing propagation from the level before.
   This allows multiple players to control time zones on the same planet without their territory
   being automatically overridden.
-On the turn immediately following an override, the time period that was overridden is a bit weak
   to counterattack allowing the defender a chance to secure their time zones from being
   overridden
    -conversely, a time zone which has just been conquered gets a defensive bonus so that a player
       who has just had a territory conquered cannot simple reconquer it and avoid any loss.
-Troops and resources taken from a later time period and brought to an earlier time period will
   eventually propagate creating more troops or resources in the long run but will leave those later
   periods vulnerable in the short term.
-Each eligible change creates a propagation order in the next time zone up a level which is
   carried out on the next turn by that time zone creating a new propagation order for the next
   time zone up unless the time zone that propagates is sealed because the time zone above was
   conquered
-Changes which would normally propagate do not propagate if there is combat in the time zone on
   that turn

The Player:
-The player has a ship capable of moving between any time zones on any planet.
-The ship can hold any number of troops and resources.
    -Troops can be taken in the ship to an enemy time zone and battle is commenced, should the
       attacker win, they claim the time zone. A wall preventing propagation is created on the
       level below and propagation begins upward, overriding the time zones above. The player
       can move troops and / or resources to their new time zone.
    -Troops can be taken to a friendly time period to reinforce against enemy attack

Combat:
-Combat between 2 groups of troops is decided by the power levels of the troops. If you are
   attacking a group of troops that is 1.2 times as strong as you, you need 1.2 times as many
   troops. When a battle begins, it takes multiple turns to resolve allowing both sides time
   to reinforce. Attacking troops can be left to fight while the player moves around.
    -During a combat phase, a certain number of troops on the attacking side are essentially
       traded for their effective power level of defending troops modified by building and
       any other modifiers
-When a time period is conquered, the resources and buildings within remain.
-Buildings can be destroyed in combat. Players can give orders to attack or avoid attacking
   buildings when attacking. They can also give order to either defend or sacrifice buildings
   when defending. Buildings can even be destroyed by defenders in scorched earth.

Order of a turn:
1. Player can move their ship from one time zone to another once and can load or unload troops
   and / or resources once per turn in any order but only once each. ---
2. Player troops heal ---
3. Resource Generation for each time zone ---
4. Troop training and building building for each time zone ---
5. Combat for each time zone that has combat -/-
   5a. Buildings destroyed if applicable
   5b. Troops killed ---
6. Integration even in time zones with combat ---
7. Propagation ---

Win Condition:
-Control every time period on the map

=====================================================================================

Playtest 1:
Players:
-Me
-Dan

Notes:
-Dan would like to be able to train troops in time periods where he is not present [Dan] ---
-Any player can see time period control buttons for time periods owned by the player whose turn it is [Me] ---
-Build menu had doubled buttons [Dan] ---
-Feels slow, should be, but maybe too slow [Me]
--Multiple trades per turn ?? [Me]
-Several Time Periods showed "War" when no combat was there [Me] ---
--Might be if there are no armies there it sees != 1 and so it counts as combat [Me] ---
-Board gets a bit wonky [Me]

Post-game Notes:
-Trade Menu, Build Menu, and Time Period Control Button styling should match the rest of the game [Me] ---

=====================================================================================

Playtest 2:
Changes:
-Can train troops and build on your time periods even if you are not present
--Also fixed bug where players can see controls they shouldn't be able to
-Build menu buttons shouldn't double up anymore
-Time periods shouldn't display war when no war anymore
-Train Troop button displays correct cost
-Trade Menu, Build Menu, and control buttons styling match rest of UI better
-Players are now assigned a color and all of their stuff appears in that color

Players:
-Me
-Mirabai
-Dan
-Ben

Notes:
-Dan followed ben into a time period and their troops killed each other. Leaving Dan with no troops and no time periods. [Me]
--The Propagation brought his troops forward restart the fight each time. This saved Dan allowing him to retreat and fight elsewhere.
--Balancing issue, no changes now
-Dan appeared twice in the present players on a time period [Ben - Me]
--Can't replicate and shouldn't happen, may be related to the same bug that caused the crash. will have to watch
-Game crashed when Ben tried to submit turn [Ben  - Me] ---
-- Performing end of turn cycle calculations

--Mirabai Owned the leftmost planet and here conquest propagation happened every time but then it failed so it happened on the second planet which is where Ben and Dan were fighting. Something they did in their fight caused a crash. ---

=====================================================================================

Playtest 3:

Changes:
-Fixed the issue causing the crash that ended the last test.
-Changed the way propagation worked so now changes ill propagate into time period with active war but not out of time periods with war.
-Changes to the way the UI determines to add the war tag so it is more consistent.
-Added tabs to the selected time period display

Things to watch:
-Dan followed ben into a time period and their troops killed each other. Leaving Dan with no troops and no time periods. [Me]
--The Propagation brought his troops forward restart the fight each time. This saved Dan allowing him to retreat and fight elsewhere.
--Balancing of early game fights and the potential to lose right away
-Players appearing twice in the present players box of a selected time period.
-Does the game feel too slow
-Do the tabs in the selected time period display feel better or clunky

Players:
-Me
-Ben
-Dan

Notes:
-Case sensitive names is annoying [Dan+Ben] ---
-Initial reactions to new tab system good [All] ---
--Tab should stay open when selecting a new time period [Dan] ---
-Because you have a whole turn before conquests propagate, you can take your troops out before and
 they wont propagate which leaves all of your time periods vulnerable ---
-Troops and buildings should be 1 faster, that got reverted at some point [Me] ---
--As did troop healing percent back to 0.1 from what should be 0.2 [Me] ---
-Still feels kinda slow: 2 of each action could be interesting [Me+Dan] ---
-Unclear that you can't trade in a time period you are not in [Dan] ---
--Maybe the trade button should only appear if you can trade in the selected time period [Me] ---
-Build queue functionality unclear [Ben] ---
--Should be clearer which build will be progressing [Me] ---
-Build queue stays when time period is conquered [Me]
-Turns should be hidden until everyone has submitted and you see the result so a later player can't
 react to the actions of an earlier player. [Ben]
-Trade screen values can still have too many decimal places [Me] ---
-Dan briefly saw player cards duped in the players list box [Dan] ---

=====================================================================================

Playtest 4:

Changes:
-You can now login without matching case
-All players can now make their turn at the same time and submit whenever and all turns will be
 calculated at the same time at the end so later players don't get the advantage of seeing what
 earlier players did and earlier players don't get the advantage of getting places first
-Selected Tab in Selected Time period Info will stay open when selecting different time periods but
 reset when deselecting or if you have controls selected and select a time period you don't control 
-Control buttons now change color to more clearly display whether or not you can use them based on
 where you are and where you have selected
-Players can now move and trade twice per turn
-Trainings troops now 2 instead of 3. Building buildings now 4 instead of 5 turns. Troops now heal 0.2 instead of 0.1.
-Changed the format of the build queue to better convey how it works

Things to Watch:
-Duplicate players in the player list display. This shouldn't happen as the list is cleared when
 drawn but Dan did see it
-Because you have a whole turn before conquests propagate, you can take your troops out before and
 they wont propagate which leaves all of your time periods vulnerable
-Does the game feel faster and more fun for it
-Does it feel like you can produce enough units
-Do the time periods feel TOO similar and unimportant.
--Should the variation in resource production be larger between time periods
--Should we move to a multiple resource type system where certain time periods are better for
  certain resources
---Could do 3 types of resources, each time period generates a balanced randomized amount of each
   and the troops and buildings in each time period take a balance randomized amount of each so
   the best troops may take resources that you have to get more of from other time periods so that
   some time periods are valuable for a certain type of resource and some are valuable for the
   quality of its troops.
----Balanced in the way that troop quality is balanced to resource gen: as one gets higher the
    other gets lower.
-----Have a set number for total resources generated, probably the one I have now which is
     proportional to the troop quality; and take a random percentage of that for the first
     resource, then another random percentage of the remaining amount for the second resource,
     then the remainder for the third resource


Players:
-Me
-Dan
-Ben
-Justin

Notes:
-Conquest Propagation is not happening [Me] ---
-Trading out of a time period in broken [Me] ---
--Resources blanks the trade window [Me+Ben] ---
-Trading troops can fix their health [Me] ---
-Seeing war when only enemy troops [Justin] ---
--Trading troops out left an empty army and said war when no troops present [Me] ---
-Can't trade resources into a time period [Me] ---
-Buildings feel too expensive [Many] ---
-Trade window does not specify the health of troops [Me] ---

=====================================================================================

Playtest 5:

Changes:
-Fixed the conquest propagation issue
-Troops no longer heal to full in the player's ship

Things to Watch:
-If combat is resolved in 1 turn, most players won't see it as the troops will arrive and die
 in 1 turn and only the final gamestate will be sent out to players
-Seeing war when only enemy troops
-Duplicate players in the player list display. This shouldn't happen as the list is cleared when
 drawn but Dan did see it
-Because you have a whole turn before conquests propagate, you can take your troops out before and
 they wont propagate which leaves all of your time periods vulnerable
-Does the game feel faster and more fun for it
-Does it feel like you can produce enough units
-Do buildings still feel too expensive once you get deeper
-Do the time periods feel TOO similar and unimportant.
--Should the variation in resource production be larger between time periods
--Should we move to a multiple resource type system where certain time periods are better for
  certain resources
---Could do 3 types of resources, each time period generates a balanced randomized amount of each
   and the troops and buildings in each time period take a balance randomized amount of each so

     then the remainder for the third resource

Players:
-Me
-Ben
-Dan

Notes:
-Deselect Button in trade screen doesn't work [Me] ---
-Canceling a trade doesn't reset the selected troops and resources [Me] ---
-Error in propagation froze the server [Me] ---

-If a player splits there troops on turn one it makes them extremely vulnerable on turn 2 ---
-Turn counter would be nice [Dan+Ben] ---
--Move up to now list box could also be nice so you can see what you have done [Me] ---
-Players could move in an old game when a new game started [Many] ---
--some sort of game validation/id would be helpful ---
-Total power on troop list could be nice [Me] ---
-Trading a troop made a different troop also disappear [Me] ---
--Probably the same ID which is checked in the transfer function [Me] ---
-Troops should have a better name [Ben] ---
--Battalion, Platoon, etc ---
-Being unable to un-submit turns became annoying if someone submitted early by mistake [Many] ---
-Troops wont propagate if they are brought in during a war, even if they survive the war [Me]---
-Sometimes take 2 planets when conquering [Many] ---
--Probably an issue with conquering and then propagation happening in the same turn [Me] ---

-Something should show after you hit submit to make it clear that your game board has reverted to
 before you took your turn [Me]
-Combat feels kinda dumb and simplistic [Dan+Me]
--Damage dealt should probably be a ratio comparing the power levels of each troop [Me]
--With only 1 troop max dying per round, spamming small troops onto a time period can make a
  battle last literally forever. [Me]
---A big troop should probably be able to kill multiple tiny troops at once. [Me]

-Power levels should be hidden until you take a planet [Ben]
-What does scorched earth do [Ben]
-Lot of double clicks. Submitting 2 turns, building 2 troops [Ben+Dan]
-Time period controls stayed up when selecting a time period where they shouldn't [Me]
-Trade button disappeared when should have had 1 use left [Ben]

=====================================================================================

Playtest 6:

Changes:
-You can no longer submit a turn using a previous gamestate on a new server instance
-Players can now take back a submitted turn as long as all players have not submitted triggering end of turn calculation
-Players only start with 1 troop
-Turn counter and list of actions taken thus far on UI
-Army lists now show a total level and total health
-Propagation will now happen properly when a time period is conquested and another player immediately attacks that time
 time period. It will happen after the war resolves.

Things to Watch:
-Duplicate players in the player list display. This shouldn't happen as the list is cleared when
 drawn but Dan and I have both seen it
-Do buildings still feel too expensive once you get deeper

Players:
-
