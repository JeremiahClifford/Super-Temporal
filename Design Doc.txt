The Specifics:
-Temporal Warfare is a game of perfect information: that is, all players can see the troops,
   resources, and buildings in each time zone and in each players' ship at all times.

The Setting:
-5 (temp number) planets which are all separate and do not interact
-Each planet has 10 (temp number, maybe 15) time zones which each act as a territory

The Time Zones:
-Each time zone has resources, buildings, troops and stats.
-Each time zone level is 2 times as powerful as the level before
-Additionally, each time zone has a small randomly generated modifier which makes it slightly
  different from the same level on different planets
-Each territory generates resources each turn.

Resources:
-Resources are used to build buildings
-You must have resources in a time zone to build in that time zone.

Buildings:
-Building are built on time periods using resources
-Buildings can change the time period specific troop modifier: making troops trained there better
-Buildings can be used to increase resource generation
-Buildings can give defenders a defensive boost on that specific time period

Troops:
-Training troops costs resources upfront
   -a certain number of troops is then output each turn until the ordered amount has been created
   -the player must be in a time zone to order troops to be created
-Troops all carry with them the stats from the time zone they were created in
-Each troop has the time zone level value
    -This can be changed through integration
-Each troop has the modifier value from the specific time zone in which is was created
    -This can not be changed
-Each troop has an experience value gained from taking part in combat which increases its power
   -this increases when the troops engages in combat

Integration:
-If a troop spends a turn in a time zone of a higher level than it is, it integrates, moving up 1
   level until it matches the time zone level that it is in
-Troops that are of a higher level than the time period they are in will not integrate.

Propagation:
-Whenever resources are generated, moved in, or moved out; buildings are built or upgraded; or 
   troops are trained, moved in, or moved out, that change propagates, that is, to then be added 
   to the next time zone up a level at the level appropriate to that level
      if troop of a lower level are added, such that they will later integrate, they are propagated
      up 1 level, not all the way up to the level of the next time zone
-When a time zone is conquered, a wall is created preventing propagation from the level before.
   This allows multiple players to control time zones on the same planet without their territory
   being automatically overridden.
-On the turn immediately following an override, the time period that was overridden is a bit weak
   to counterattack allowing the defender a chance to secure their time zones from being
   overridden
    -conversely, a time zone which has just been conquered gets a defensive bonus so that a player
       who has just had a territory conquered cannot simple reconquer it and avoid any loss.
-Troops and resources taken from a later time period and brought to an earlier time period will
   eventually propagate creating more troops or resources in the long run but will leave those later
   periods vulnerable in the short term.
-Each eligible change creates a propagation order in the next time zone up a level which is
   carried out on the next turn by that time zone creating a new propagation order for the next
   time zone up unless the time zone that propagates is sealed because the time zone above was
   conquered
-Changes which would normally propagate do not propagate if there is combat in the time zone on
   that turn
-IDEA: All time zones are default set propagate all things. When a time zone is conquered, the time
   zone before is set so that changes still propagate except for troops as they would have died in
   the combat. The player can move to any time zone they control and set it to not propagate. This
   be useful as propagated troops can reinforce a battle but can mean that buildings and resources
   that you generate can also be given to an opponent unless you travel to that time zone and 
   manually turn off propagation.

The Player:
-The player has a ship capable of moving between any time zones on any planet.
-The ship can hold any number of troops and resources.
    -Troops can be taken in the ship to an enemy time zone and battle is commenced, should the
       attacker win, they claim the time zone. A wall preventing propagation is created on the
       level below and propagation begins upward, overriding the time zones above. The player
       can move troops and / or resources to their new time zone.
    -Troops can be taken to a friendly time period to reinforce against enemy attack

Combat:
-Combat between 2 groups of troops is decided by the power levels of the troops. If you are
   attacking a group of troops that is 1.2 times as strong as you, you need 1.2 times as many
   troops. When a battle begins, it takes multiple turns to resolve allowing both sides time
   to reinforce. Attacking troops can be left to fight while the player moves around.
    -During a combat phase, a certain number of troops on the attacking side are essentially
       traded for their effective power level of defending troops modified by building and
       any other modifiers
-When a time period is conquered, the resources and buildings within remain.
-Buildings can be destroyed in combat. Players can give orders to attack or avoid attacking
   buildings when attacking. They can also give order to either defend or sacrifice buildings
   when defending. Buildings can even be destroyed by defenders in scorched earth.

Order of a turn:
1. Player can move their ship from one time zone to another once and can load or unload troops
   and / or resources once per turn in any order but only once each.
2. Resource Generation for each time zone
3. Troop training for each time zone
4. Combat for each time zone that has combat
    4a. Buildings destroyed if applicable
    4b. Troops killed
5. Integration even in time zones with combat
6. Propagation

Win Condition:
-Control every time period on the map
